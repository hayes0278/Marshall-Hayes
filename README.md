# Hello, I am Marshall Hayes
A full stack software developer from Virginia, USA.

## + About Me
- I have been focused lately on Hibernate and Entity Framework to work with object relational mappers more closely.
- I work in C# and Java to build clean, scalable, and affordable application solutions.
- Lately I have been exploring coding with AI, Cloud, and Security technologies to help broaden my knowledge.
- Apart from coding, in my spare time I enjoy playing the drums and making homemade soap.
